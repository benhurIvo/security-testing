# Security Testing

The purpose of the project was to analyse ‘schoolmate’ a PHP/MySQL web application for elementary,
middle and high schools; to identify the Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities it contains and fix
them. Then, tests were carried out to verify if the vulnerabilities were fixed right. This was done using a
tool called JwebUnit, a Java-based testing framework for web applications.
